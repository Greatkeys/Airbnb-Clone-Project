1. What do props help us accomplish?
Props help us make components more reusuable

2.  How do you pass a prop into a component?

A prop is passed just like a regular html attribute
e.g. <MyAwesomeHeader blablahblah="Greatkeys" />

3.  Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. "blahblahblah={true}") to a native DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblahblah={true}></div>) why or why not?

No a custom prop such as blablahblah can't be passed to normal DOM elements because it is not specified in HTML docs and as such cant be recognized.

4.How do i receive props in a component?
function Navbar (props){
    return (
        <header>
            ...
        </header>
    )
}

simply by fixing prop as a parameter of the function, we can receivethe props

5. What data type is "props" when the component receives it?
Object
